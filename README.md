# Programming and Scripting Project
## Problem Statement
This project concerns the well-known Fisher's Iris data set. You must research the data set and write documentation and code in Python to investigate it. An online search for information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated it previously.

You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed.

**1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it**

Sir Ronald Fisher (1890-1962) was a British statistician and geneticist, and has been described as "the single most important figure in 20th century statistics". In 1936 he introducted the multivariate data set referred to as the Iris flower data set, or Fisher's Iris data set, in his paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes referred to as Anderson's Iris data set, as it was Edgar Anderson who collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species, which are Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. There are 150 rows of data in the data set, with each row representing an iris flower, as well as its species and the dimensions of its sepal and petal in centimeters.
